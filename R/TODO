*1. add two functions, 
    BANOVA.model(model_name = 'Normal'): visualize the model code, can be modified, return the model code
    BANOVA.build(model_code = BANOVA.model object): stanc the model code, stan model it, return the BANOVA stan model
    BANOVA.NormalNormal needs to have the stan model argument and return the stan model
  
*2. build independent stan modules in addition to the JAGS models (create branch v10), other JAGS models stays the same, adding one level models to JAGS, BANOVA.NormalNormal needs to be changed back

*3. multinomial model related functions needs to be refined 

*4. predict functions need to be done, plus predict.BANOVA

*5. beta2_1_1 vs beta1_1 in the old jags model in the table.predictions issue needs to be fixed (use if else)

*6. ordered multinomial model issues: 
*after calling app_7 <- BANOVA.ordMultinomial (perceivedsim~1, ~progress*prodvar,  goalstudy, goalstudy$id, burnin = 1000, sample = 1000, thin = 1)
then >> app_7
coefficents table is printed twice!

*7. cut point or other unkown parameters not converged, try to use the same initials or change to single level?

*8. single level models

*9. multinomial, table.ancova needs to change for each choice, choice_intercept + variables, the assign values and corresponding estimates

10. investigate table.ancova negative values

11. multinomial case, factors are the same across all choices, means different levels of the factor has the same probability estimation. will be cancelled in the final prob/sum

*12. add parameter:single_level to old BANOVA.* models, so that summary/table.predictions can work

13. add loglikehood to compare various models including single level vs two level models

*14. trace.plot, conv.diag, floodlight, mediation, etc. other funcitons

15. save compiling time: option 1: follow the methods of prophet, install.libs.R, and zzz.R; option 2: follow the brms package, remove the compiling warning message, but still compiling

15. fix all cran check issuew
